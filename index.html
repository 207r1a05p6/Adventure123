    <p class="text">Mountain Man is jagged and has patches of grass and trees on his knees, feet, and arms, which he has despite being a mountain. His limbs haven't been used as of yet.Mountain Man is very temperamental. He's been upset due to the Marauders. He obviously cares for other creatures' well being.
     <br> <br> Another mountain stands behind him who loves staring at his gorgeous back, which has short grass, a stream and two hills which appear to be his butt. He speaks with the voice of an old man.

    <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text">
    Surfing is a water sport where an athlete performs manoeuvres on a wave while standing on a board.When surfers see a wave they can ride, they paddle quickly to catch the rising wave. Just as the wave breaks, the surfers jump from their bellies to their feet, crouching on their boards. Being able to stand up is the mark of an experienced surfer. Surfers ride the wave as it breaks toward the shore.
    <br> <br> Men and women from all over the world practice surfing, and the surfing community shares a concern for the ocean environment.
